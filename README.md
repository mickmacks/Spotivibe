# Project 1 - Spotivibe

Our app integrates an internal API and MongoDB to create a website hosted on Heroku, address https://infinite-everglades-53281.herokuapp.com/.

Users are presented with cards, each with music playlists, that the user can create, edit or delete. Each Genre has unique background image and song.
